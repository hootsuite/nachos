/**
 * An extension of {@link android.widget.MultiAutoCompleteTextView.Tokenizer Tokenizer} that provides extra support
 * for chipification.
 * <p>
 *     In the context of this interface, a token is considered to be plain (non-chipped) text. Once a token is terminated it becomes or contains a chip.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The CharSequences passed to the ChipTokenizer methods may contain both chipped text
 *     and plain text so the tokenizer must have some method of distinguishing between the two (e.g. using a delimeter character.
 *     The {@link #terminateToken(CharSequence, Object)} method is where a chip can be formed and returned to replace the plain text.
 *     Whatever class the implementation deems to represent a chip, must implement the {@link Chip} interface.
 * </p>
